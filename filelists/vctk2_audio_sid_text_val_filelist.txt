DUMMY2/p259/p259_457.wav|7|He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.)
DUMMY2/p236/p236_176.wav|75|Is there a waiting list ?
DUMMY2/p340/p340_094.wav|74|I'm delighted to be coming back home.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_068.wav|93|I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
DUMMY2/p243/p243_270.wav|53|Its primary business channel is the internet.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_206.wav|78|We can take the city.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_206.wav|55|There remains some Scottish influence, however.
DUMMY2/p237/p237_118.wav|61|On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
DUMMY2/p256/p256_249.wav|90|I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_090.wav|6|But someone has got to do it.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_399.wav|74|I reported it but nothing was done.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_396.wav|24|The marshall at the turn was great.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_248.wav|47|He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
DUMMY2/p250/p250_008.wav|24|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_153.wav|42|That's my big challenge.
DUMMY2/p271/p271_009.wav|27|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p363/p363_181.wav|6|He can do everything.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_306.wav|106|They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
DUMMY2/p226/p226_185.wav|43|It is not fair.
DUMMY2/p264/p264_458.wav|65|The technology looks excellent.)
DUMMY2/p363/p363_368.wav|6|We have a business to run.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_336.wav|72|Yes, it was too short a night.
DUMMY2/p239/p239_287.wav|48|However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_184.wav|107|No, it's actually in a block of flats.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_039.wav|22|There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_009.wav|84|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p310/p310_254.wav|17|We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
DUMMY2/p305/p305_242.wav|54|They were not doing it too well, either.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_187.wav|4|Another man said, It was horrible.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_199.wav|22|Frankly, it was worth the booking.
DUMMY2/p323/p323_032.wav|34|Leisure centres were also affected.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_463.wav|89|The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_134.wav|11|They are a good team.
DUMMY2/p279/p279_199.wav|25|There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
DUMMY2/p244/p244_073.wav|78|Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
DUMMY2/p269/p269_286.wav|94|If not, he should go home.
DUMMY2/p306/p306_183.wav|12|This one was my best chance.
DUMMY2/p270/p270_232.wav|8|There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
DUMMY2/p258/p258_145.wav|26|The FBI could become involved.
DUMMY2/p245/p245_271.wav|59|She looked so young.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_278.wav|105|It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p236/p236_343.wav|75|Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
DUMMY2/p307/p307_303.wav|22|Either group is living in fantasy land.
DUMMY2/p280/p280_052.wav|52|We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
DUMMY2/p267/p267_086.wav|0|They need to find a form of words.
DUMMY2/p374/p374_054.wav|11|But the cost to his health was enormous.
DUMMY2/p249/p249_141.wav|80|It's a question of fashion.
DUMMY2/p234/p234_077.wav|3|Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
DUMMY2/p276/p276_121.wav|106|I am not very pleased.
DUMMY2/p233/p233_375.wav|84|Treatment is not an issue with these people.
DUMMY2/p304/p304_156.wav|72|The tournament has now been cancelled.
DUMMY2/p255/p255_070.wav|31|Then followed a bout of flu.
DUMMY2/p257/p257_021.wav|105|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_222.wav|39|The defender should have won the bloody ba.
DUMMY2/p254/p254_056.wav|41|That time has passed.
DUMMY2/p273/p273_331.wav|56|The airport was even different.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_035.wav|76|We are doing very well as we are.
DUMMY2/p288/p288_107.wav|47|They were behind the wheel.
DUMMY2/p329/p329_414.wav|103|He was not seeking special advantage.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_236.wav|10|Women were mostly notable by their absence.
DUMMY2/p277/p277_157.wav|89|We also enjoyed a lot of support.
DUMMY2/p297/p297_354.wav|42|Gilbert was not amused.
DUMMY2/p259/p259_162.wav|7|There's only one team in Ayrshire.)
DUMMY2/p240/p240_362.wav|93|That is a break with tradition.
DUMMY2/p345/p345_342.wav|82|He is already in place.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_336.wav|14|Then followed a bout of flu.)
DUMMY2/p232/p232_227.wav|96|At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_131.wav|10|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p340/p340_280.wav|74|The director's a genius.
DUMMY2/p241/p241_197.wav|86|Is that success?
DUMMY2/p308/p308_401.wav|107|All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
DUMMY2/p278/p278_220.wav|10|The only problem was the greens.
DUMMY2/p263/p263_200.wav|39|We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
DUMMY2/p287/p287_051.wav|77|It depends on the couple.
DUMMY2/p361/p361_405.wav|79|We are going nowhere.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_066.wav|2|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_062.wav|18|Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
DUMMY2/p326/p326_150.wav|28|Yet it does not lose appeal.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_375.wav|14|They have broken that promise.)
DUMMY2/p293/p293_118.wav|23|These are long-term investments.
DUMMY2/p265/p265_091.wav|73|It is a love affair.
DUMMY2/p336/p336_065.wav|98|I let go the telephone and ran.
DUMMY2/p313/p313_339.wav|76|I can't believe the buzz.
DUMMY2/p261/p261_003.wav|100|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p294/p294_036.wav|104|Michael, he is running!
DUMMY2/p305/p305_259.wav|54|The death rates are still as high.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_195.wav|2|I came home by ambulance.
DUMMY2/p311/p311_271.wav|4|They didn't find any substance.
DUMMY2/p285/p285_112.wav|2|It is so sad.
DUMMY2/p238/p238_279.wav|37|I came up through the ranks.
DUMMY2/p252/p252_390.wav|55|I'm not sure that's right.
DUMMY2/p362/p362_302.wav|15|But we all have to look at ourselves.
DUMMY2/p292/p292_117.wav|13|They offered to make an investment into it.
DUMMY2/p308/p308_307.wav|107|The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
DUMMY2/p246/p246_095.wav|5|Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
DUMMY2/p240/p240_227.wav|93|I am immensely sad.
DUMMY2/p247/p247_121.wav|14|That might help a bit.)
DUMMY2/p330/p330_006.wav|1|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p339/p339_259.wav|18|The memory is there.
DUMMY2/p272/p272_056.wav|69|They were on holiday in Egypt.
