DUMMY2/p376/p376_273.wav|71|"If not, he should go home."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_239.wav|88|It was a long time coming.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_228.wav|71|"Half of young people had had contact with the police."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_168.wav|71|"They will do their own thing."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_156.wav|88|Ferguson had done his homework.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_297.wav|88|It was just one man.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_161.wav|33|Paterson can afford to be generous.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_162.wav|21|Dancing was her life.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_231.wav|33|We are pursuing legal action against the government.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_251.wav|33|That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_363.wav|33|You will never forget the clutching horror.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_227.wav|71|"And thought we would get away with it."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_113.wav|88|It was just great.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_191.wav|71|"I am totally surprised."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_128.wav|21|Then came the crunch.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_282.wav|33|We just wish they had done so before.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_019.wav|71|"Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows. "
DUMMY2/p364/p364_240.wav|88|It had happened to him.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_187.wav|71|"It is a terrible loss."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_099.wav|71|"Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_072.wav|33|I feel alive and good today.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_310.wav|33|And it had been a marvellous occasion.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_171.wav|21|It has been handled entirely properly.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_094.wav|71|"The selection process is still at a very early stage."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_020.wav|88|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_134.wav|33|We can play better than that.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_158.wav|71|"My Dad is a hero."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_340.wav|33|So we talked about that for a bit.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_084.wav|71|"That will come after the game on Saturday."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_055.wav|21|My mother is a widow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_252.wav|33|Now we are back on top of Europe.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_207.wav|33|Six years is too long.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_036.wav|88|It was very moving, actually.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_335.wav|21|We played them off the pitch.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_284.wav|21|Would they work together again?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_163.wav|88|There was nothing anyone could do.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_125.wav|88|This means that our programme is quite unusual.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_164.wav|33|I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_033.wav|33|As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_341.wav|33|But he has strong links to Labour.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_144.wav|88|I don't entirely buy that.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_001.wav|71|"Please call Stella.  "
DUMMY2/p343/p343_326.wav|21|It is time, he said.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_183.wav|71|"I saw military vehicles in the distance."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_089.wav|71|"The oil companies would be asked to contribute."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_144.wav|21|But not all were so defiant.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_107.wav|71|"We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_008.wav|88|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_181.wav|33|She didn't tell me anything the night before.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_159.wav|33|The whole thing in general is moving on.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_232.wav|33|Perhaps that was their mistake.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_179.wav|21|This has been very frustrating for him.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_288.wav|71|"He should have won."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_049.wav|33|He met his wife and married in England.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_076.wav|33|His track record is impressive.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_035.wav|88|It shouldn't be a problem.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_082.wav|71|"It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_074.wav|71|"She died in hospital two hours later."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_155.wav|33|This was a very tragic accident.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_150.wav|33|Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_198.wav|21|Well, you can have a tree.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_382.wav|33|They were just too good for us.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_152.wav|71|"The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_188.wav|71|"Suddenly, the rugby world had changed."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_343.wav|33|I am a doctor.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_130.wav|71|"We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_269.wav|71|"People have no choice."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_185.wav|88|There are two offerings from Scotland.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_184.wav|21|Footage has been passed on to the police.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_092.wav|88|But this has already been rejected.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_228.wav|33|I grew up with them.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_301.wav|88|Is he any good?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_028.wav|88|I love you so very much.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_375.wav|21|You have to do your research.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_179.wav|71|"Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_011.wav|71|"When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. "
DUMMY2/p343/p343_207.wav|21|He is helping police with their inquiries.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_198.wav|88|You would be wrong.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_118.wav|88|It has been a great success.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_146.wav|88|The casting of her husband was an accident.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_312.wav|33|Either system could have prevented the crash.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_225.wav|71|"However, no further action was taken by police."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_166.wav|33|It feels that the game is off.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_083.wav|88|His arrival could be the making of them.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_349.wav|21|That had not happened on this occasion.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_157.wav|71|"Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_064.wav|33|The devil is in the detail.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_136.wav|71|"Nobody in the world can get away from him."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_140.wav|21|That was a good effort.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_169.wav|88|I hope that doesn't happen.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_265.wav|33|There he goes again.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_162.wav|88|I don't know where it went.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_262.wav|33|I certainly hope not.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_017.wav|88|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_418.wav|33|It was visibly on fire.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_180.wav|21|The talking cannot go on too long.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_134.wav|88|I love a clever reader.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_206.wav|21|I was influenced by all of these things.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_234.wav|88|It was all over for us then.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_135.wav|33|My whole family is.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_141.wav|33|We will be victorious.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_097.wav|71|"But it was a pleasure."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_128.wav|88|This time, it was not be.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_195.wav|21|The hotel was huge.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_364.wav|21|There's a hint of classical.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_215.wav|71|"That has been the easy part."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_123.wav|71|"Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_063.wav|88|It is not the fault of one man, of course.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_197.wav|88|The hearing continues today.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_111.wav|33|You have caught a serial killer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_330.wav|33|They're just a nonsense.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_293.wav|71|"That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_054.wav|71|"But the law is very clear on this."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_118.wav|33|There's nothing new in that argument.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_116.wav|71|"She has been shot."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_090.wav|71|"I love the Dome."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_221.wav|88|I had no choice.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_396.wav|21|Sub Not Used, McArthur.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_146.wav|21|I told that to the police.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_191.wav|88|The principle is quite clear.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_052.wav|21|There was still more disquiet in Israel.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_118.wav|71|"Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_159.wav|21|When it comes down to it, this is a job.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_391.wav|33|All were believed to be adults.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_277.wav|71|"You've got to have both sides."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_260.wav|33|I think it was his parents.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_264.wav|21|There is no room for error.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_240.wav|21|Is a drug dealer?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_298.wav|88|It's going to be tough.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_009.wav|88|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_068.wav|21|It's funny how it comes and goes.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_050.wav|88|What do you think they said?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_197.wav|21|A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_398.wav|33|I only wanted to give her a fright.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_191.wav|21|That tells you something.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_038.wav|21|We are a team of hard workers.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_078.wav|71|"It is not long term, but I need time to recover."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_342.wav|21|The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_268.wav|71|"The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_189.wav|88|We do know the reaction of the SAC.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_007.wav|71|"The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors. "
DUMMY2/p364/p364_051.wav|88|There will be no disruption in the schools.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_070.wav|88|They've got more time.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_051.wav|71|"He looks like an Afghan."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_267.wav|33|I feel pretty good.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_368.wav|33|The pain is still acute.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_273.wav|21|Again, we were lucky.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_016.wav|71|"The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky. "
DUMMY2/p376/p376_257.wav|71|"They are never here."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_229.wav|71|"Well, they were the unlucky ones."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_031.wav|71|"So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_015.wav|71|"The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain. "
DUMMY2/p364/p364_129.wav|88|They are unable to say anything.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_255.wav|71|"It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_158.wav|33|It is the voice of the survivors.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_062.wav|88|You make the choice.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_212.wav|88|I can handle the pace.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_023.wav|21|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_195.wav|33|I now know that from memory.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_166.wav|71|"I was in the train station overnight."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_021.wav|21|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_095.wav|33|Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_291.wav|21|I would rather say nothing at the moment.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_191.wav|33|This was a great result for us, a big result.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_324.wav|33|They were impressive against France.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_081.wav|21|Once they go away they won't come back.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_193.wav|71|"The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_096.wav|88|Allison is not convinced.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_169.wav|21|On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_266.wav|88|This could be the case.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_042.wav|33|What are the barriers?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_025.wav|21|I've got a long way to go.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_371.wav|21|I have to take some of the blame.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_014.wav|88|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_375.wav|33|Our message is getting through.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_025.wav|33|It was by the numbers.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_276.wav|71|"Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_387.wav|21|Because it's a secret.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_424.wav|33|I kept going for her.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_176.wav|33|I think we're going to make it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_095.wav|88|It was good to score the goal today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_079.wav|88|He wanted to talk to me about it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_173.wav|71|"First and foremost, the game is entirely different."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_151.wav|88|It was too soon.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_111.wav|88|I know the worry over Iraq.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_186.wav|33|We are still paying the price for that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_351.wav|21|As a nation, we must become more active.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_287.wav|33|I've not said anything to them, they know.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_194.wav|71|"We've had an enjoyable adventure."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_085.wav|21|We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_024.wav|21|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_093.wav|71|"Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_202.wav|71|"It was worth a photograph."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_237.wav|88|I am very encouraged by this poll.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_136.wav|33|However, everyone should do it once in their life.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_386.wav|21|They will have five minutes to decide.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_056.wav|21|Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_275.wav|21|He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_160.wav|21|It had been played at festivals.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_030.wav|88|Prime minister Blair is not that way.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_084.wav|88|I was close enough.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_075.wav|33|It was a pretty terrible day.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_241.wav|88|That is our business.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_407.wav|33|But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_335.wav|33|Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_367.wav|21|In the end, however, it all came together.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_257.wav|21|Horses are not affected.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_410.wav|33|Everyone has his share of trouble.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_082.wav|33|He was rejected because he had retired.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_054.wav|21|I must take a seat.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_060.wav|71|"The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_062.wav|21|But that's another story for another day.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_188.wav|21|It was good today.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_094.wav|21|It is par for the course, of course.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_042.wav|21|That was the theory, anyway.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_202.wav|21|This is an internal matter.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_236.wav|21|Men should avoid it like the plague.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_414.wav|33|This is a successful outcome.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_106.wav|88|Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_152.wav|33|There is nothing they can't do.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_079.wav|71|"Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_241.wav|71|"We will need to study the report before any decision is taken."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_238.wav|33|He is doing the right things.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_020.wav|33|Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_100.wav|21|Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_146.wav|33|Mr Smith was dismissive.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_017.wav|33|Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_290.wav|21|The princess has had other health problems.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_196.wav|71|"Is that success?"
DUMMY2/p343/p343_173.wav|21|Is something which we just don't do.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_096.wav|21|The winner will be announced next month.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_094.wav|33|The matter is under discussion.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_292.wav|21|The clarity is vital.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_034.wav|88|The man has already had too many chances.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_149.wav|21|But when we do it it is great.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_168.wav|33|Well, what can you do?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_253.wav|33|Now the show is for public consumption.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_105.wav|71|"I'm so angry."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_201.wav|21|He said to give a local injection.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_040.wav|21|And you know something?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_176.wav|21|He will want to utilise the midfield.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_293.wav|21|I could not sit in the stands.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_308.wav|33|I've played them all in the Champions League.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_170.wav|33|They will be seen for years to come.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_140.wav|71|"The boy is no longer with us."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_286.wav|21|The answer is yes.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_135.wav|88|There will be no exceptions to this rule.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_091.wav|71|"We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_266.wav|21|As, indeed, they would be.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_238.wav|21|Our positions remains unchanged.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_138.wav|33|During the communist time they were very privileged.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_296.wav|33|Were they under-age?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_223.wav|71|"Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_060.wav|33|They have been very lucky with the ice.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_086.wav|21|Both sides have been hit by injury.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_227.wav|88|This is very good news.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_237.wav|33|That is important for the club.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_265.wav|21|Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_139.wav|21|This is the logic of punishment assaults.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_019.wav|21|Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_040.wav|33|We are getting people into work.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_217.wav|33|He took over our lives.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_062.wav|33|My players are special.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_008.wav|33|These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_246.wav|21|He died later in hospital.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_145.wav|33|It's just a fact.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_160.wav|71|"This year, this month, will be special for Torrance."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_255.wav|88|This is as bad as it gets.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_379.wav|33|My heart is not so sure.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_336.wav|21|The service from the other players was super.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_228.wav|88|Is it a warning to parents?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_241.wav|33|They want to play in the World Cup.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_265.wav|88|Israeli forces denied the claim.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_329.wav|33|The board is currently resolving its differences.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_305.wav|33|He could hardly have been in greater demand.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_211.wav|88|I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_243.wav|71|"I can't get a job."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_234.wav|71|"We have a free vote on these things in our party."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_126.wav|33|In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_102.wav|33|That is not true.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_215.wav|88|I believe it would have been successful.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_331.wav|21|He was a one off.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_151.wav|33|He is walking free.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_061.wav|71|"Four other charges were dropped."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_026.wav|88|Our nation has been changed by this event.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_016.wav|21|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_252.wav|88|It was a nightmare.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_285.wav|33|They chose the latter.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_175.wav|71|"There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_125.wav|33|Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_396.wav|33|You read it right.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_170.wav|71|"The release attracted little attention."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_078.wav|21|They were at school together.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_007.wav|21|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_129.wav|71|"If not, a deal could take many months."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_295.wav|33|She thought she was going to die.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_228.wav|21|It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_348.wav|33|Money is not everything in life.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_052.wav|71|"They had to explain it."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_131.wav|21|The answer is maybe.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_288.wav|33|It is giving out the wrong message.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_123.wav|21|Well, the big day has arrived.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_049.wav|71|"A recording contract is on the horizon."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_122.wav|33|We were not going to take that risk.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_343.wav|21|It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_295.wav|21|Strikers like to go to the ground.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_102.wav|21|I am not a doctor.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_162.wav|33|No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_098.wav|88|This is a one-off.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_172.wav|33|He will be greatly missed.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_088.wav|88|The couple had one daughter.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_278.wav|21|But it's not the end of Scottish football.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_199.wav|21|Or so it is hoped.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_378.wav|33|They promised to fight the plans.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_112.wav|88|The outcome is now in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_072.wav|21|We could have got three medals.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_042.wav|88|Since then it has become a tradition.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_266.wav|71|"She has every confidence in his performance of his duties."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_281.wav|88|He was at the game, and he is indeed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_381.wav|33|Finally, he paid for the movie.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_197.wav|33|We expect a full house on the night.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_306.wav|33|Who can predict?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_155.wav|71|"We also enjoyed a lot of support."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_356.wav|33|That is a trend which will be encouraged.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_174.wav|71|"This is a sad day."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_292.wav|33|Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_250.wav|71|"The pensioners did not want to know."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_059.wav|71|"It will take time."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_336.wav|33|I lost a part of me.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_324.wav|21|Otherwise we would all pay the price.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_089.wav|33|That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_421.wav|33|A number of people could not speak English.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_420.wav|33|We will be pleased to talk to them.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_127.wav|71|"It will be too hot."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_069.wav|21|It was just awful.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_216.wav|21|He has the edge.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_027.wav|21|We will be back next year.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_225.wav|33|I think it is a scandal.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_101.wav|21|We can only go up.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_003.wav|71|"Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.  "
DUMMY2/p364/p364_117.wav|88|It was an important part of the course.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_055.wav|88|The president took offence.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_309.wav|88|We're talking to him.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_015.wav|21|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_208.wav|88|I am really, really happy.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_021.wav|71|"The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases. "
DUMMY2/p351/p351_044.wav|33|Who are the democrats?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_063.wav|33|We are the gateway to justice.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_401.wav|33|I am very excited about this season.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_071.wav|88|They made a huge impression on me.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_066.wav|71|"There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_068.wav|71|"It should be devolved."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_362.wav|21|So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_255.wav|21|However, my position remains the same.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_332.wav|21|That should give me a chance.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_099.wav|21|It may well have been.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_226.wav|21|They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_196.wav|88|I put the drawing down.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_193.wav|88|I would say the risk is very small.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_415.wav|33|His first album was a hit.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_234.wav|33|The way forward is working with other disciplines.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_075.wav|21|The script was funny.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_028.wav|33|My Dad is a hero.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_108.wav|71|"Maybe this battle has been."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_260.wav|88|FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_288.wav|21|The second aspect was the fear of failure.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_100.wav|71|"We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_114.wav|21|After this, they were always in the driving seat.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_275.wav|88|Horses have some sense.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_177.wav|88|It's very very frustrating.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_093.wav|33|Only he's not as young as he looks.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_176.wav|88|I learned that only yesterday.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_134.wav|71|"It was typical."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_206.wav|71|"I had relied on him."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_090.wav|21|I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_041.wav|33|Will we ever play together again?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_344.wav|33|Secondly, there are other options for patients.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_369.wav|21|The warning was lifted late last night.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_037.wav|88|It isn't a free-for-all.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_173.wav|88|England will be under a lot of pressure.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_294.wav|71|"He has retired."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_251.wav|21|We will turn the corner.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_177.wav|71|"It is the whole package."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_267.wav|88|We try to keep it right.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_192.wav|88|Despite that, it was a great day for me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_006.wav|33|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_043.wav|33|He is keen to stay in public service.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_201.wav|88|Our destiny is in our own hands.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_071.wav|33|It's really good, as long as we play well.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_173.wav|33|Sadly, they don't seem to know.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_102.wav|88|This takes the pressure off.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_092.wav|71|"They are now divorced."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_199.wav|88|On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_355.wav|33|It's only tackling congestion.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_128.wav|33|He has something in common with the Wallabies.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_007.wav|33|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_161.wav|88|It is not illegal.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_245.wav|21|They have not been named.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_145.wav|71|"It is like a football team."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_251.wav|88|It was really surprising.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_045.wav|33|You had to go and see him.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_027.wav|71|"He said the matter had been neglected in the past."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_166.wav|21|His is a success story by any standard.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_004.wav|21|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_270.wav|88|For many, it had become a fact of life.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_151.wav|21|He pleaded for caution.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_048.wav|71|"The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_137.wav|33|A career as a doctor is on hold.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_310.wav|21|Last night, the company could not be contacted.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_319.wav|21|It is not easy to live in Russia.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_171.wav|71|"Waiting times for these services are too long."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_088.wav|71|"Then came the crunch."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_016.wav|33|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_016.wav|88|The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_164.wav|21|Staff have been informed.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_069.wav|88|It lasted longer than we thought.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_170.wav|21|Do they have to create seven majors?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_278.wav|88|Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_058.wav|33|The jury is still out.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_220.wav|88|That suggests that out fitness is good.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_337.wav|21|That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_390.wav|33|But it didn't happen.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_276.wav|33|We have been very patient.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_250.wav|88|We just need the Government to act.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_039.wav|88|I was not fit enough and it showed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_356.wav|21|It comes down to the police in England.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_028.wav|71|"We have to pull together, or we will hang apart."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_150.wav|21|I'm going to win the gold.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_337.wav|33|It's so much more fun.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_104.wav|21|And we have beaten them before.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_247.wav|88|Stand by for action.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_109.wav|88|Success in Scotland is important.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_195.wav|71|"The group is separate from the Real IRA."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_133.wav|21|The referee had a shocking game.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_317.wav|21|I will work on her.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_066.wav|33|We have got the school holidays on.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_181.wav|88|It's part of your life.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_053.wav|33|There is no signature on this document.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_219.wav|33|This is a historic agreement.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_104.wav|71|"It's not a new concept in jazz."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_321.wav|21|What on earth is happening to rugby?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_235.wav|21|The players are obviously keen to do well.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_144.wav|33|But it will be sorted out this week.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_316.wav|21|She went home from school and never returned.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_352.wav|21|At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_299.wav|21|I was totally wrong.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_048.wav|88|The trial will open today.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_124.wav|33|But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_025.wav|71|"It's a relief that a decision has finally been made."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_103.wav|71|"According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_012.wav|88|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_013.wav|71|"Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation. "
DUMMY2/p351/p351_039.wav|33|I have got a wife to feed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_142.wav|33|The other question is why the scaling down?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_003.wav|33|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_079.wav|33|This youngster is so exciting!
DUMMY2/p364/p364_160.wav|88|He has gone back to school.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_237.wav|21|It's really good fun.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_064.wav|71|"George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_285.wav|21|I can feel the sound inside.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_037.wav|21|It should be the reverse.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_121.wav|33|It is a great shame.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_272.wav|88|It was a definite penalty.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_009.wav|71|"There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end. "
DUMMY2/p351/p351_143.wav|33|It was the crowning point of my career.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_239.wav|71|"The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_219.wav|88|It was very, very frightening.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_032.wav|21|But it might have done.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_065.wav|71|"An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_091.wav|88|I didn't have the choice.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_145.wav|88|It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_036.wav|33|They also have good neighbours.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_274.wav|21|There was no argument.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_236.wav|33|The case was continued.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_250.wav|21|Actually, nothing much will change.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_084.wav|21|I didn't understand it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_115.wav|33|The way forward isn't going to be easy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_370.wav|33|It is a very big problem.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_086.wav|88|I said How much?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_400.wav|21|I love the feel of the place.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_392.wav|33|This is the last straw.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_322.wav|33|At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_334.wav|21|It is my last chance.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_118.wav|21|That is the position the MoD has adopted.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_061.wav|33|We are not the first to be affected.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_102.wav|71|"He takes the job."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_097.wav|88|He felt there was no case to answer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_254.wav|33|I want to create events.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_259.wav|21|I'm not going to change from it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_171.wav|33|I'm really happy with how things went there.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_077.wav|88|Who is he?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_092.wav|21|He's got the same story.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_227.wav|33|That, though, was then.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_373.wav|33|The cause is just.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_042.wav|71|"A neighbour said."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_270.wav|33|He has a wealth of experience.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_033.wav|21|Nor is it likely to do so.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_217.wav|21|This was not a summit about the euro.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_250.wav|33|They seem to turn up for them.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_047.wav|21|That's what we're trying to achieve.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_039.wav|71|"They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_119.wav|33|This time it was out of the blue.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_355.wav|21|We will need to look at that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_234.wav|21|He is the saviour of South Africa.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_283.wav|71|"It happens from time to time."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_274.wav|71|"It is not a process which can be completed overnight."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_113.wav|21|The odds are that it will.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_069.wav|33|The working families tax credit is far better.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_080.wav|33|I don't understand it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_347.wav|21|That will just be the beginning.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_290.wav|88|I have been here for only three months.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_259.wav|88|That's the last thing he will do.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_123.wav|33|Last night he became one of the hunted.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_098.wav|71|"We live by the rule of law."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_359.wav|33|He was, but only just.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_112.wav|71|"This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_127.wav|33|The truth, of course, is very different.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_346.wav|33|Our season is not over.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_190.wav|21|I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_028.wav|21|I was very, very pleased with our display.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_070.wav|33|those who are preparing to give up.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_002.wav|71|"Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.  "
DUMMY2/p364/p364_244.wav|88|It was a surprising decision.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_072.wav|88|There is no hiding place.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_076.wav|71|"Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_107.wav|88|We are not leaving the area.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_050.wav|21|It is a beautiful country.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_235.wav|71|"We lost our composure towards the interval, he said."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_145.wav|21|We are not going to get carried away.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_199.wav|71|"The sisters also became the top two players in the world."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_076.wav|21|We are at the crossroads.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_107.wav|21|I am not a paedophile.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_109.wav|33|Who will pay for this?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_132.wav|88|He just attracted people.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_155.wav|21|They've been wonderful to me.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_151.wav|71|"The weaknesses are few."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_147.wav|71|"He will emerge as a world leader."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_219.wav|71|"It is a gamble."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_386.wav|33|Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_148.wav|33|My neighbours are horrified.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_090.wav|33|This is already happening.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_348.wav|21|No one can say that about me.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_354.wav|21|HARRY Potter has lost his magic.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_197.wav|71|"The service from the other players was super."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_226.wav|88|It hasn't worked out that way.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_108.wav|88|The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_149.wav|33|They will be ready.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_202.wav|33|Ownership was the game.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_192.wav|33|Our policy is clear.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_011.wav|88|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_035.wav|21|I read it every year.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_325.wav|33|Seven people were already in custody in France.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_239.wav|33|Blood samples were taken.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_109.wav|71|"But the fans deserve to know!"
DUMMY2/p376/p376_056.wav|71|"Next league matches Celtic."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_143.wav|21|He had finally had enough.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_246.wav|71|"I watched a game."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_298.wav|33|It is a very worrying report.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_153.wav|33|It certainly was a birthday to remember.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_207.wav|71|"I began to pray."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_198.wav|33|He invented the language.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_178.wav|33|Clubs can only do so much.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_047.wav|88|We must not give in to bastards.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_222.wav|21|That was never their agenda.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_263.wav|21|That idea is rubbish.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_119.wav|21|The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_116.wav|33|It's the way we go about it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_005.wav|71|"She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station. "
DUMMY2/p364/p364_103.wav|88|Our legal advice is clear.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_370.wav|21|There is always the smell.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_143.wav|88|It is sponsored by The Herald.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_186.wav|71|"I had a train to catch."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_419.wav|33|What's it for, after all?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_163.wav|21|The latter way is my way.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_245.wav|71|"We have got no money to go anywhere."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_321.wav|33|However, it has had only a limited uptake.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_086.wav|33|Friday night was a pretty good night.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_248.wav|71|"The car was just there."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_383.wav|33|He was the architect.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_272.wav|71|"It's so awful."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_161.wav|71|"There's a pause."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_015.wav|88|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_081.wav|88|That would be a big mistake.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_163.wav|33|The other is the existence of male colleagues.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_115.wav|21|I had no intention of misleading anyone.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_256.wav|21|It was totally out of the blue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_132.wav|33|But, still, it wasn't working.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_111.wav|71|"Who would be a referee?"
DUMMY2/p351/p351_139.wav|33|There has been no delay on government orders.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_046.wav|21|He died the following year.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_283.wav|88|It is a victory to that extent.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_188.wav|33|There will be no change in government.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_004.wav|71|"We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.  "
DUMMY2/p364/p364_002.wav|88|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_246.wav|33|He is under no illusions.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_204.wav|71|"HARRY Potter has lost his magic."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_057.wav|21|Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_291.wav|33|He's had a lot of injury problems.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_029.wav|88|Scotland needs to hear it, too.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_051.wav|33|This isn't a gimmick.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_270.wav|21|That is a question for the next manager.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_261.wav|71|"Immediate action must be taken."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_038.wav|71|"It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_210.wav|88|I'm not interested in money.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_300.wav|21|This has got to stop.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_268.wav|33|It's got to come from me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_216.wav|33|Which is fair enough.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_347.wav|33|I am not retiring.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_022.wav|88|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_059.wav|21|I don't believe in gesture politics.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_388.wav|33|He, too, was not satisfied.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_257.wav|88|That can happen so easily.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_024.wav|33|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_387.wav|33|Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_366.wav|33|We are not asking for the moon.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_263.wav|33|This is a dream come true for me.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_167.wav|88|The post will be unpaid.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_365.wav|21|We had to take action to protect them.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_267.wav|71|"Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_126.wav|71|"Twaddle is a case in point."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_043.wav|88|The concept is simple.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_003.wav|21|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_175.wav|33|In many ways, that is as important.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_169.wav|71|"You had to go and see him."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_349.wav|33|She kept him on a string.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_189.wav|71|"I would love it."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_099.wav|88|He liked to talk.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_100.wav|88|Lots of others were doing the same.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_184.wav|33|The parties have no contact.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_154.wav|71|"Mr Blair had done well."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_231.wav|88|I could not believe the results.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_129.wav|33|These will take a little time to develop.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_165.wav|21|It is one of those things.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_044.wav|21|I had troubles with the producers.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_047.wav|33|We know we can defend it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_041.wav|21|We were with him the whole time.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_120.wav|88|Who will take them after that?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_167.wav|71|"By then, however, both men were already in the US."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_399.wav|33|Where does it come from?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_374.wav|21|He is lying to save his skin.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_193.wav|33|This was an hour before the show.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_085.wav|71|"Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_242.wav|71|"I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_079.wav|21|I am looking forward to getting home.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_230.wav|71|"It's very safe."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_225.wav|21|That's the only thing that matters.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_218.wav|33|The problem is worse in Scotland.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_303.wav|33|He then did just that.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_055.wav|33|There was mystery back then.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_055.wav|71|"We were surprised to see the photograph."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_248.wav|88|It was something special.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_165.wav|33|It is not an escape.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_403.wav|33|Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_187.wav|88|The matter has been reported to the police.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_057.wav|88|Partly, it is his own fault.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_014.wav|21|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_303.wav|21|It is a real concern.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_116.wav|88|It's an old story.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_213.wav|21|His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_053.wav|88|I can live with that.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_292.wav|71|"The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_252.wav|71|"This court has made an order which has not been observed."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_177.wav|33|It was really frustrating.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_131.wav|71|"The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_035.wav|33|We have to win every game.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_189.wav|33|I am just grateful he is alive.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_140.wav|33|I think we can overcome it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_240.wav|71|"It is a policy which has the full support of the minister."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_385.wav|33|It's a fantastic achievement.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_007.wav|88|The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_136.wav|21|For a few years we had good fun.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_153.wav|88|I don't think it is the case.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_281.wav|21|The error appeared in a warrant.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_120.wav|71|"She really suffered for her art."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_080.wav|21|Painful, but only because it's true.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_057.wav|33|Now it has become a big picture.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_226.wav|71|"They had no children."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_106.wav|21|Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_166.wav|88|Now they have to do something about it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_149.wav|88|It's a good story.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_249.wav|88|He deserves a top team.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_121.wav|21|This decision is destroying my family.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_038.wav|88|PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_203.wav|33|It makes a huge difference.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_346.wav|21|He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_277.wav|21|I just need a bit of luck.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_137.wav|21|All the pressure will be on him.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_195.wav|88|Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_053.wav|21|This was never a support group.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_205.wav|21|That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_068.wav|88|I see no need to change.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_081.wav|71|"No progress has been made."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_095.wav|71|"Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_031.wav|33|He added, We have the same desire.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_218.wav|88|I had a son.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_128.wav|71|"It's the big omission."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_217.wav|71|"Clearly, the stakes are high."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_224.wav|21|She is currently in foster care.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_284.wav|88|Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_005.wav|21|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_279.wav|21|We are talking about one family.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_180.wav|33|It would have very little impact on them.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_101.wav|88|It is still holding good today.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_184.wav|71|"The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_110.wav|33|This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_408.wav|33|If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_213.wav|88|I am happy to be here.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_026.wav|21|I'll go to the races.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_182.wav|71|"Miller was every bit as happy."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_305.wav|88|I chose the former.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_394.wav|33|I am so, so, so lucky.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_171.wav|88|You will never replace the child.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_099.wav|33|They were unable to revive him.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_309.wav|21|A compromise is essential.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_119.wav|88|I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_159.wav|88|Mr Blair defended his wife.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_210.wav|71|"The FBI could become involved."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_056.wav|33|We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_150.wav|88|Do not listen to them.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_061.wav|88|No-one knows the numbers.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_041.wav|71|"It is urgent."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_259.wav|33|It was like being in prison.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_083.wav|21|That was the easy election.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_083.wav|71|"They lived for their children."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_361.wav|33|Further details are expected later.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_011.wav|33|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_182.wav|33|That's the way things are heading.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_082.wav|88|No-one has spoken to me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_275.wav|33|This is not a message from ministers.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_150.wav|71|"The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_333.wav|21|Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_092.wav|33|Four had been brought down.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_130.wav|33|I might come back.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_030.wav|21|People don't feel safe, including me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_065.wav|33|His handling raises a wider issue.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_085.wav|88|He dismissed the action.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_405.wav|33|But is he?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_048.wav|21|He is trying really hard.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_325.wav|21|Our thoughts are with her.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_253.wav|71|"That is highly unfair."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_006.wav|71|"When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow. "
DUMMY2/p364/p364_073.wav|88|A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_032.wav|33|Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_334.wav|33|He will go a long way.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_300.wav|88|I really want to win in Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_376.wav|21|He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_136.wav|88|But he's a very quiet man.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_069.wav|71|"Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_309.wav|33|Then you see it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_104.wav|33|I didn't deserve to be sent off.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_033.wav|88|We're not either of those things.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_275.wav|71|"There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_243.wav|21|Where are you taking her?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_010.wav|71|"People look, but no one ever finds it. "
DUMMY2/p351/p351_114.wav|33|Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_262.wav|71|"Frankly, we should all have such problems."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_223.wav|33|I was happily surprised.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_213.wav|33|At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_288.wav|88|It will not be today, though.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_086.wav|71|"This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_313.wav|33|Here, the fans have been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_332.wav|33|He also called in at another farm.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_322.wav|21|It is now being examined.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_040.wav|88|I thought it was the only way out.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_001.wav|21|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_238.wav|71|"In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_254.wav|71|"It's all change on the music scene in Manchester."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_339.wav|33|It's getting to me.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_208.wav|71|"I am delighted for Simon."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_126.wav|88|The money all appears to be gone.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_392.wav|21|It just isn't a defining issue for them.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_368.wav|21|He is a visionary.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_298.wav|21|It's the whole package.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_124.wav|88|What can you say?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_074.wav|88|This was a massive result for us.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_059.wav|88|The family is so happy for him.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_134.wav|21|I haven't been able to do it since.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_249.wav|71|"I am very angry."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_254.wav|88|We can do it.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_246.wav|88|I believe in having difficult times.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_258.wav|21|It went on forever.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_377.wav|21|He took away my childhood.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_306.wav|88|Sub Not Used, McKee.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_351.wav|33|There was no basis for their arrest.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_067.wav|21|Funding needs to be long term.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_201.wav|71|"I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_106.wav|33|We have no excuses.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_027.wav|88|That would be a big step forward.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_247.wav|71|"Chelsea was a great club."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_205.wav|33|It's not a new device.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_379.wav|21|The call was ignored.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_243.wav|88|The car driver was not injured.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_358.wav|21|It is a gamble.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_050.wav|71|"It has been a horrible, horrible time."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_273.wav|33|All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_112.wav|21|I would love to play in Europe again.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_164.wav|88|I don't want to use the term.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_012.wav|33|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_087.wav|88|I support the stand that they are making.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_276.wav|21|She is a valuable member of Government.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_056.wav|88|Our commitment is to move forward.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_050.wav|33|Instead we were shot in the back.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_258.wav|71|"That review will look at management across the sector as a whole."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_257.wav|33|We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_268.wav|21|We are all suffering.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_245.wav|88|Colin Cameron was excellent.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_003.wav|88|Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_258.wav|88|We deserved to get the victory today.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_295.wav|71|"It became a book by itself."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_133.wav|71|"Police could not say if the two incidents were connected."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_137.wav|88|Destruction came from within.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_001.wav|88|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_174.wav|88|This has been fantastic.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_371.wav|33|Frustration is not the word.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_214.wav|33|No decision has yet been made.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_017.wav|71|"Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically. "
DUMMY2/p351/p351_256.wav|33|The old manager, he didn't like me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_331.wav|33|That has not been the case, as we now know.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_023.wav|71|"If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow. "
DUMMY2/p364/p364_203.wav|88|I've got nothing to say.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_144.wav|71|"The idea is simple."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_064.wav|21|He has really done well.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_222.wav|71|"Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_293.wav|88|I know we ask a lot of you.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_360.wav|21|The tribunal continues today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_179.wav|88|But he did not rule out further talks.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_318.wav|33|He had no access to the database.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_308.wav|88|They were very responsive.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_018.wav|33|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_163.wav|71|"He's been the key to everything."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_182.wav|21|I hope that that will be forthcoming.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_094.wav|88|They have not seen her for years.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_098.wav|21|I am not a fan of books.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_087.wav|21|No one was listening.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_126.wav|21|It has been a great day.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_290.wav|71|"A new school will be built."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_022.wav|33|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_131.wav|88|That's why he is a national treasure.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_132.wav|21|The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_284.wav|71|"He was obviously very genuine."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_096.wav|71|"It was mayhem."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_216.wav|88|It's better to be happy.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_002.wav|21|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_416.wav|33|The salary changes are long overdue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_210.wav|33|If only the problems concerned the players.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_103.wav|21|It is all in the mind.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_233.wav|88|And there are some interesting conductors, too.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_149.wav|71|"The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_289.wav|21|That is a personal matter.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_248.wav|21|He had a great game.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_345.wav|21|So you let me know.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_088.wav|33|One year later, he finally decided to act.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_029.wav|71|"Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_269.wav|21|People should make their own decisions.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_280.wav|88|We have to get on with it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_399.wav|21|The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_328.wav|21|We must learn to finish.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_183.wav|88|He had a horror.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_075.wav|88|It's not in my nature.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_083.wav|33|I just wanted to get off the course.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_215.wav|21|The hearing was fair.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_161.wav|21|That never came to court as a charge.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_201.wav|33|I went away to recover fully.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_078.wav|88|Scotland were on Saturday.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_138.wav|71|"We've got a lot of respect for the Lions."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_223.wav|88|It would also delay the Scottish results.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_417.wav|33|The plane was shaking.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_116.wav|21|But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_316.wav|33|But these things are happening now.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_301.wav|33|It was an ongoing exercise.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_058.wav|71|"This is a step backwards."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_239.wav|21|We are expecting a big crowd.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_089.wav|88|But was it really so big?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_266.wav|33|However, there could be more bad weather to come.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_232.wav|71|"Hospitals are for the ill."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_183.wav|21|But experience is a wonderful thing.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_096.wav|33|Surely this is not supposed to happen?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_216.wav|71|"We could be here for a number of weeks."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_188.wav|88|We are at war.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_178.wav|71|"It's an idea."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_301.wav|21|It was a matter of chance.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_323.wav|21|It is so out of character.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_175.wav|88|I'm delighted for the lads.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_148.wav|21|In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_024.wav|71|"This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_078.wav|33|It is tough, but possible.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_023.wav|88|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_307.wav|33|It was all very proper and civilised.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_130.wav|88|The timing is wrong.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_279.wav|33|My only concern is for my children.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_404.wav|33|It should be a great game, though.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_022.wav|21|The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_019.wav|88|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_249.wav|33|It has become a way of life.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_013.wav|33|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_221.wav|71|"My wife and family are the support system."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_033.wav|71|"Because we do not need it."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_220.wav|21|I didn't actually work up a speech.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_400.wav|33|You find it bizarre?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_412.wav|33|Everything else is second.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_229.wav|88|Everything is surrounded by confusion.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_157.wav|21|I can't believe the buzz.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_320.wav|33|He also seems to have been around forever.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_036.wav|21|I go in for the parts.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_196.wav|21|These days are over.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_357.wav|33|It's too horrible to think.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_013.wav|88|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_278.wav|33|They have a car and cannot afford another.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_186.wav|21|If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_390.wav|21|I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_211.wav|33|But it was money well spent.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_156.wav|71|"I was in daily contact."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_117.wav|33|I will be ridiculed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_308.wav|21|They really shouldn't have put it out.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_148.wav|71|"They did very well."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_076.wav|88|You see - this business is a good one.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_157.wav|33|If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_210.wav|21|I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_121.wav|88|It is part of their job.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_101.wav|71|"Oil embargo endorsed."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_046.wav|33|What did you learn in school today?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_372.wav|21|And if he hasn't become a musician?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_287.wav|21|I believe in debate and dialogue.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_110.wav|88|We could do a lot worse.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_178.wav|21|I am looking forward to this film.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_101.wav|33|In part that reflected the times.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_112.wav|33|It's all about money, money, money.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_221.wav|33|We just want them home.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_286.wav|33|That was not the norm.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_282.wav|21|Everything is so new.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_029.wav|21|It is a crucial award.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_071.wav|21|We played too deeply.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_289.wav|71|"Sunday's game was not a trial."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_052.wav|33|I won't go back.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_194.wav|88|And there are different perspectives.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_054.wav|33|We could not compete with Rangers.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_212.wav|71|"His death was a tragic accident."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_168.wav|88|One-third of the places are already taken.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_256.wav|88|The real issue is personal.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_066.wav|88|He leaves a beat.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_260.wav|71|"He was popular."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_111.wav|21|But we can't have a casino.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_141.wav|21|We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_034.wav|71|"It's a matter of balance."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_213.wav|71|"On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_045.wav|88|And that's the trouble with this business.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_026.wav|71|"But it failed."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_271.wav|21|I knew people on that committee.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_190.wav|71|"Last night was a key episode."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_297.wav|33|You are going to go to jail.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_299.wav|33|I started it, but then forgot all about it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_071.wav|71|"They do not work for Glasgow City Council."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_263.wav|88|I've seen it work already.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_061.wav|21|He should be a great asset.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_247.wav|33|It got no better.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_323.wav|33|Others are expected to do so soon.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_311.wav|33|We don't believe anything anymore.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_204.wav|21|They made such decisions in London.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_302.wav|33|I would love to see it back there.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_124.wav|21|We reckon we can do very well.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_344.wav|21|They will be up for it for sure.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_233.wav|33|We've never seen so many.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_067.wav|88|Perhaps it was her demeanour.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_015.wav|33|The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_131.wav|33|He said it was the worst possible result.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_365.wav|33|I believe she was elected unopposed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_223.wav|21|But he kept on repeating it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_051.wav|21|I expect a rapid response.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_064.wav|88|I knew the script.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_046.wav|71|"That should do it."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_127.wav|21|We are not with you.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_328.wav|33|It's my initial background.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_108.wav|33|The driver was unhurt.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_031.wav|21|Survival is our aim.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_075.wav|71|"It is a job creation scheme."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_200.wav|88|Police have refused to name the couple involved.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_129.wav|21|If so, they were wrong.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_026.wav|33|I don't think they can complain about that.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_292.wav|88|I was the willing journeyman.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_147.wav|33|It was a discussion paper.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_013.wav|21|Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_057.wav|71|"Sadly, it can't."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_302.wav|21|There is no point of looking any further.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_004.wav|88|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_021.wav|88|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_227.wav|21|The service will only survive with change.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_209.wav|33|It's a very important and beautiful day.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_040.wav|71|"It was clear."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_381.wav|21|It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_264.wav|33|No other country has ever won this tournament.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_342.wav|33|I am proud of my team.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_293.wav|33|It happened again, and again, and again.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_286.wav|88|She died later on Monday.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_067.wav|71|"We should have known."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_098.wav|33|They have played their part.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_158.wav|21|It is a traffic warden.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_208.wav|21|The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_043.wav|71|"We need to chat."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_097.wav|21|What was this?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_066.wav|21|This happened on three days inside a week.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_160.wav|33|They might also be parlous.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_158.wav|88|We want to know about the policy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_319.wav|33|They were not up to the required standard.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_065.wav|88|It's not going to work.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_184.wav|88|So it was in politics.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_087.wav|33|Things are meant to be.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_103.wav|33|Yes, it was too short a night.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_085.wav|33|He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_073.wav|21|I am ready to go.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_204.wav|88|It requires a wider team.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_091.wav|21|It's terrible that this is happening.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_008.wav|71|"These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon. "
DUMMY2/p343/p343_122.wav|21|Why is that?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_097.wav|33|This is a defining moment in this parliament.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_068.wav|33|That just wasn't good enough.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_354.wav|33|The Government has listened.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_114.wav|71|"It is a delight on every level."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_398.wav|21|There is no formula.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_002.wav|33|Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_023.wav|33|If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_005.wav|33|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_125.wav|71|"Well, you can have a tree."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_175.wav|21|It is, though the law is not clear cut.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_383.wav|21|And there is another problem.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_059.wav|33|Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_179.wav|33|Many other areas are coming up.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_035.wav|71|"And we have a singer."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_187.wav|21|Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_172.wav|71|"A helpline number is published at the end of this article."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_089.wav|21|We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_148.wav|88|I've had six days of rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_382.wav|21|We don't do this for everyone, of course.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_202.wav|88|The attitude was good today.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_114.wav|88|You are always aware of the injury potential.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_159.wav|71|"The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_364.wav|33|Off with their heads.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_077.wav|21|I am about protecting the state pension.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_215.wav|33|I have had a lovely summer.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_261.wav|33|That is very important to people.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_394.wav|21|Which he is, too.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_214.wav|88|We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_087.wav|71|"She told The Herald."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_203.wav|21|Entries from the event are still being accepted.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_196.wav|33|Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_012.wav|71|"Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways. "
DUMMY2/p351/p351_422.wav|33|They have got off with murder.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_073.wav|71|"Neither it is."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_391.wav|21|They are there to help us.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_022.wav|71|"The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows. "
DUMMY2/p343/p343_192.wav|21|It has been a magical moment.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_224.wav|33|It may not even be possible.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_231.wav|71|"Sadly, it sounds as if it is."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_315.wav|33|For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_209.wav|88|This is perfectly legal.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_327.wav|33|Our approach will be different.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_358.wav|33|It can be frightening.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_282.wav|71|"Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_320.wav|21|Green is desperate to play on The Open.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_049.wav|88|But it didn't happen.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_236.wav|71|"It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_282.wav|88|It would be dangerous to resign.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_241.wav|21|We did not complete the process.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_369.wav|33|This was not the show for me.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_140.wav|88|It won the match.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_045.wav|21|So, it took me back to boarding school.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_031.wav|88|But at the moment there isn't the budget.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_340.wav|21|We're not comparing like with like.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_005.wav|88|She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_402.wav|33|It has proved a double whammy.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_256.wav|71|"There is no link."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_409.wav|33|Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_135.wav|21|It's about doing things.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_338.wav|33|That's just the kind of thing we have.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_232.wav|88|What do you do?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_280.wav|71|"Parents should avoid it."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_010.wav|21|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_009.wav|33|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_304.wav|88|This was repeated the second time.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_141.wav|71|"There is a lack of chemistry."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_333.wav|33|But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_177.wav|21|Two others were also seriously injured.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_287.wav|88|It does and it doesn't.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_109.wav|21|Not that it was needed.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_024.wav|88|This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_389.wav|33|It's easy to see why.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_395.wav|21|Each one is as good as the other.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_192.wav|71|"I came home by ambulance."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_046.wav|88|So what did he do?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_165.wav|88|I really feel sorry for the Irish.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_100.wav|33|He confirmed that the document was valid.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_014.wav|33|To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_384.wav|21|That is the theory.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_367.wav|33|Now we see the impact of global politics.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_165.wav|71|"Military action is the only option we have on the table today."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_178.wav|88|We want him to continue that way.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_393.wav|21|You take a risk.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_372.wav|33|The police have to act to help them.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_025.wav|88|Is that not pathetic?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_304.wav|21|Is it the flight?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_043.wav|21|We've all been here before.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_224.wav|71|"We're looking for justice."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_147.wav|21|On the other hand, the poster did not help.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_001.wav|33|Please call Stella.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_132.wav|71|"It's not true."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_139.wav|71|"I think he's the favourite, no question."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_115.wav|71|"Here, again, they were denied a voice."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_264.wav|88|Do you mean today?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_027.wav|33|I have not seen the term immediate.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_212.wav|33|That's the most important thing for me.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_294.wav|21|He had a decision to make.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_277.wav|88|And now he has decided, enough.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_093.wav|21|They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_229.wav|21|As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_271.wav|88|Last season was very hard for me.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_122.wav|71|"Death is outside the language."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_374.wav|33|It may be down, but New York is not out.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_174.wav|21|That began as an accident.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_153.wav|71|"It was deployed in the Gulf War."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_260.wav|21|And they are different.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_181.wav|21|I've got a young family.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_152.wav|21|It always had to be about the gym.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_313.wav|21|The children continue to talk to us.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_280.wav|21|He is not a pathetic figure.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_285.wav|88|I certainly hope so.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_238.wav|88|We just do not do it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_281.wav|33|The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_018.wav|71|"Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain. "
DUMMY2/p351/p351_084.wav|33|She was also very brave.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_393.wav|33|The research was my life.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_105.wav|21|Many others are subjected to violence by men.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_314.wav|33|There is good quality.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_350.wav|21|After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_222.wav|33|His was the best performance of the day, after all.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_258.wav|33|The ministers are now to make their decision.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_245.wav|33|Haven't been so lucky since.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_185.wav|33|He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_012.wav|21|Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_058.wav|88|That's where it all started.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_067.wav|33|We can't go home.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_174.wav|33|But is that possible?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_205.wav|71|"That is an important part of our role."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_236.wav|88|Thankfully they liked it.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_345.wav|33|It will carry on.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_211.wav|71|"A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_267.wav|21|If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_110.wav|71|"It is rubbish."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_247.wav|21|It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_259.wav|71|"It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_261.wav|21|It would have been very easily done.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_172.wav|21|I shall be voting Yes to support him.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_048.wav|33|That is not the case.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_296.wav|21|It makes no influence on the public.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_182.wav|88|We will see how he is.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_217.wav|88|It's happened, but it's a dream.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_036.wav|71|"Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_037.wav|33|Both sides will be aware of this.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_243.wav|33|This is excellent news for the workforce.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_170.wav|88|It's all happening at a local level.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_220.wav|33|He had worked there for only two days.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_244.wav|71|"He said he intended to push for a judicial review."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_284.wav|33|The rest, of course, is history.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_034.wav|21|What can you do?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_363.wav|21|Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_230.wav|21|You have a very persuasive president.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_360.wav|33|It may be his last for a while, too.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_082.wav|21|Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_130.wav|21|It is open season on the Old Firm.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_190.wav|88|The state is controlled by the left.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_233.wav|71|"It would still have been a good film, but very different."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_248.wav|33|Some were close to tears.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_279.wav|88|He made no comment.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_317.wav|33|He will be really pleased about this.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_172.wav|88|We must do that.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_044.wav|88|That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_380.wav|33|I am happy for her.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_389.wav|21|The body follows the mind.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_294.wav|33|Does it matter?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_278.wav|71|"Who will perform?"
DUMMY2/p351/p351_113.wav|33|What's the problem?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_011.wav|21|When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_146.wav|71|"It is not just about pay."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_270.wav|71|"She looked so young."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_120.wav|33|We need to get the right people in.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_018.wav|88|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_268.wav|88|I have got to keep the lid on.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_119.wav|71|"I was furious."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_021.wav|33|The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_240.wav|33|Now he is in charge of this.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_104.wav|88|But he has a lifeline.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_339.wav|21|You have been warned.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_289.wav|33|I feel it is very irrational.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_272.wav|33|It happens from time to time.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_190.wav|33|This is a special place for me.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_030.wav|33|He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_020.wav|71|"Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed. "
DUMMY2/p351/p351_107.wav|33|- Really you will !
DUMMY2/p351/p351_290.wav|33|We were used to being in control.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_194.wav|33|It is crucial to understand this in context.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_152.wav|88|It is an absolute disgrace.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_200.wav|33|We need to know more about her.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_193.wav|21|Is that not uncanny?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_251.wav|71|"It is also very valuable."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_180.wav|88|Our children are our future.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_214.wav|71|"I am really going to miss him."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_205.wav|88|It is so beautiful.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_269.wav|33|There were moments of humour too.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_361.wav|21|These things have not happened by accident.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_242.wav|21|Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_014.wav|71|"To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods. "
DUMMY2/p376/p376_070.wav|71|"We welcome the decision of Mr Byers."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_311.wav|21|They need to be involved.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_326.wav|33|I played well but missed a few chances.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_117.wav|21|He also has property interests in the country.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_377.wav|33|She makes me so happy.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_088.wav|21|I will report in the spring.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_280.wav|33|This is welcome news.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_073.wav|33|She was married with one son.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_285.wav|71|"It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_063.wav|71|"Art is extra."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_044.wav|71|"We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_230.wav|88|There is nothing wrong with that.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_181.wav|71|"Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_291.wav|71|"I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_207.wav|88|In many ways it was disastrous.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_080.wav|71|"Nothing is yet confirmed."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_200.wav|71|"The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_010.wav|33|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_203.wav|71|"I don't want to use it."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_352.wav|33|This latter suggestion is very important.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_154.wav|88|Everyone would have been happy.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_018.wav|21|Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_384.wav|33|This should include procedures for personal imports.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_225.wav|88|We just have to improve.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_108.wav|21|I've got to get noticed!
DUMMY2/p351/p351_255.wav|33|I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_299.wav|88|You will be very, very welcome.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_141.wav|88|New investment will be openly tendered.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_125.wav|21|But it's been kept to a minimum.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_105.wav|88|This is a horrible loss.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_218.wav|21|If he leaves, the band is finished.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_287.wav|71|"That could change."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_090.wav|88|Nature will not find its own level.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_077.wav|71|"This is the way things should be handled."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_230.wav|33|I would have the hammer in the crowd.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_054.wav|88|There is no doubt about that.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_070.wav|21|That is really all.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_065.wav|21|I'm just delighted to take it.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_117.wav|71|"It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_306.wav|21|Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_226.wav|33|Perhaps it was just as well.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_388.wav|21|My wife and family are the support system.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_233.wav|21|We could learn a lot from them.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_304.wav|33|He should have won.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_074.wav|33|There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_397.wav|33|They would have been forgiven for doing so.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_029.wav|33|It is my fault.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_366.wav|21|Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_154.wav|21|It's like a garage.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_315.wav|21|I cannot say too much about them.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_235.wav|88|They were assured that it would.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_253.wav|88|But this is just the first step.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_041.wav|88|We welcome the ministers decision.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_053.wav|71|"However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_411.wav|33|You need a licence to run a pub.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_122.wav|88|This decision is a victory for common sense.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_283.wav|21|It may take time to get it back.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_034.wav|33|Teachers have been given the offer.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_262.wav|88|It would be a bonus for this game.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_253.wav|21|There were too many mistakes.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_235.wav|33|I am very, very happy.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_077.wav|33|Clearly it is very disturbing.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_162.wav|71|"It was so new, so exciting."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_318.wav|21|We told them in August.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_353.wav|21|It is safe in our hands.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_263.wav|71|"Similar measures are expected in England and Wales."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_091.wav|33|We have a rehearsal.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_249.wav|21|It's still got that at its heart.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_294.wav|88|When he got up he was hit again.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_220.wav|71|"At the time, he was a living legend."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_338.wav|21|He didn't let me down.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_208.wav|33|They are not a set of options.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_153.wav|21|Only one got through.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_123.wav|88|One is too many.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_209.wav|71|"He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_032.wav|88|It is not a matter of concern.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_138.wav|88|It's not their fault.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_385.wav|21|It almost certainly is.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_303.wav|88|It was then that Rangers scored.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_110.wav|21|It's up to them to decide.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_037.wav|71|"He has not been named."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_019.wav|33|Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_289.wav|88|We suspect he was pleased.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_359.wav|21|I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_060.wav|21|The decision is purely down to the clinic.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_261.wav|88|It does not take much.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_164.wav|71|"Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_219.wav|21|He saw it all as a big game.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_155.wav|88|It has paid off.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_269.wav|88|Or so we thought.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_113.wav|71|"There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_312.wav|21|It was not a cover-up.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_222.wav|88|What do you do.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_039.wav|21|It is up to Ann.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_244.wav|33|The home team also had their moments.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_327.wav|21|Everyone believes in it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_063.wav|21|One thing is sure.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_221.wav|21|Here we have not had one hour.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_218.wav|71|"It's a question of creating a future awareness."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_362.wav|33|What's wrong with that?
DUMMY2/p376/p376_185.wav|71|"What has caused the demise of singing?"
DUMMY2/p364/p364_133.wav|88|He will be fine.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_198.wav|71|"But we are not immune to the problem."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_279.wav|71|"The death toll included five children."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_291.wav|88|We have no knowledge of this.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_060.wav|88|Why has it taken so long?
DUMMY2/p364/p364_010.wav|88|People look, but no one ever finds it.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_006.wav|21|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_264.wav|71|"We are happy."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_072.wav|71|"The price cuts are really exciting."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_395.wav|33|What is it about this series?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_214.wav|21|He said he would appeal the sentences.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_229.wav|33|It was the train coming.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_115.wav|88|We don't know what is happening to them.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_120.wav|21|I cannot believe this decision.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_302.wav|88|The proposals have been taken out of context.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_224.wav|88|This one would have been.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_121.wav|71|"So the European elections are extremely important."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_244.wav|21|The weather forecast isn't good.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_038.wav|33|They are not advertised.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_142.wav|71|"Is that Titanic?"
DUMMY2/p376/p376_030.wav|71|"Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_106.wav|71|"The fire was above the hole."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_242.wav|33|He was embarrassed about what he did.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_183.wav|33|We were extremely poor.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_081.wav|33|The band was good, and it's been a great day.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_147.wav|88|I would say so.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_378.wav|21|I have spoken to the skipper.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_300.wav|33|My mind was made up.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_341.wav|21|I started on fire a couple of times.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_276.wav|88|It goes in cycles.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_232.wav|21|She has not returned to work.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_307.wav|21|Scotland doesn't even have a target.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_286.wav|71|"He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_252.wav|21|Of course, it is a tough assignment.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_095.wav|21|And so it goes on.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_271.wav|33|Don't you think it was a fine performance?
DUMMY2/p351/p351_353.wav|33|The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_187.wav|33|It was better than a soap opera.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_262.wav|21|He knows the course.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_413.wav|33|I am not sure.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_143.wav|71|"I was awful."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_254.wav|21|He says it often enough.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_157.wav|88|He deserved that much.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_273.wav|88|It's great fun to get to act.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_211.wav|21|We want to get there.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_168.wav|21|He can do no wrong.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_135.wav|71|"It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_142.wav|21|He must not be removed from office.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_206.wav|88|It is suitable and sensible.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_074.wav|21|We are still suffering from that.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_154.wav|33|If you can work, you should work.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_242.wav|88|We were completely outplayed.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_049.wav|21|I have no doubt about that.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_133.wav|33|That was my mistake.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_283.wav|33|It was a virus.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_314.wav|21|You know the sort of thing.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_231.wav|21|It's always the same, isn't it?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_209.wav|21|Children also died in Britain.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_204.wav|33|The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_167.wav|21|Are his works inside out?
DUMMY2/p343/p343_357.wav|21|Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_045.wav|71|"It's the same old story."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_297.wav|21|It's ahead of Labour.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_206.wav|33|Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_274.wav|88|We are keen to have him back.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_032.wav|71|"We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_265.wav|71|"And Michael was just great."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_156.wav|33|THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_167.wav|33|He is very confident at the moment.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_274.wav|33|They were too hard.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_194.wav|21|Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_237.wav|71|"You can feel at home in China."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_020.wav|21|Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_406.wav|33|So it's a daily struggle.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_176.wav|71|"We are very concerned about controller fatigue."
DUMMY2/p376/p376_271.wav|71|"It was a privilege to work for him."
DUMMY2/p343/p343_397.wav|21|I have hardly any commitments.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_277.wav|33|I don't take that view.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_006.wav|88|When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_137.wav|71|"He sees a difference in the style of the two teams."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_169.wav|33|It is not the message alone.
DUMMY2/p364/p364_142.wav|88|I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_004.wav|33|We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_009.wav|21|There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_189.wav|21|She really suffered for her art.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_124.wav|71|"Some of the characters will not be played by humans."
DUMMY2/p364/p364_127.wav|88|He was extremely ill.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_423.wav|33|I'm going to take it further.
DUMMY2/p376/p376_180.wav|71|"I have no sympathy with her at all."
DUMMY2/p351/p351_199.wav|33|We want to play at the worlds.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_058.wav|21|The matter will come up again.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_350.wav|33|It will make a big difference.
DUMMY2/p343/p343_185.wav|21|Of course, there was still much to be done.
DUMMY2/p351/p351_376.wav|33|But what lies ahead?
